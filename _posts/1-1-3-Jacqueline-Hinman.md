Jacqueline C. Rast Hinman P.E. LEED, (born 1961) also known as Jacque, is one of a small number of women who run Fortune 500 companies. She is the CEO of CH2M Hill, a major US engineering company. Her position is even more noteworthy as engineering has traditionally been a field in which men have dominated. According to Mark Leftly of the UK’s Independent, since her rise to the head of CH2M Hill she is “one of the most powerful women in the industry.”
