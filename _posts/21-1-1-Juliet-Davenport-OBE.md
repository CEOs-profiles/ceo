Juliet Davenport OBE is the founder and CEO of Good Energy, one of the UKâ€™s first entirely renewable electricity supplier and generator companies. Juliet built Good Energy from scratch in 1999. Her mission then, as it is now, was to tackle climate change, help deliver energy security for the UK, and give consumers the opportunity to buy and invest in 100% renewable electricity. Juliet is also a founding director of the POWERful Women initiative, which supports improving gender diversity in the energy industry.
